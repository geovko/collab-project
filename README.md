## Description

SkyWatch is a comprehensive web application tailored to enhance the travel planning experience for users worldwide. By seamlessly integrating real-time flight 

tracking and detailed airport weather updates, SkyWatch empowers travelers with the information they need to make informed decisions and navigate their journeys 

with confidence.


Motivation: The inspiration behind SkyWatch stems from the recognition of the challenges and uncertainties travelers face when planning and embarking on trips. 

From unpredictable flight delays to unpredictable weather conditions, these factors can significantly impact travel experiences and create unnecessary stress for 

users. SkyWatch aims to address these pain points by providing a centralized platform where users can access up-to-date flight information and weather forecasts, 

enabling them to proactively plan and manage their travels effectively.
